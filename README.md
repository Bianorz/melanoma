# Melanoma Project

The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system for the classification of skin tumors. [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) is the standard library that is used here for image processing with C++ and Python scripts, while the hardware platform is a Raspberry PI 3.

## Installing OpenCV

There are several tutorials about how to install OpenCV in a linux machine (our case) but to simplify this operation one can just follow [this commands](https://github.com/Bianorz/melanoma/blob/master/command_seq_inst_opencv3.txt).

## Segmentation and Labelling

A brief explanation of how the segmentation and labelling are developed can be found [here](https://github.com/Bianorz/melanoma/blob/master/segm.md).
## Hough Transform

## MACE algorithm

## Image Classification
